Laravel Lumen is a stunningly fast PHP micro-framework for building web applications with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Lumen attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as routing, database abstraction, queueing, and caching.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Lumen website](http://lumen.laravel.com/docs).

## Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability within Laravel, please send an e-mail to Taylor Otwell at taylor@laravel.com. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

### Install

Clone the MirrorMirror web app with this command:

>git clone https://github.com/ctrlaltdylan/MirrorMirror.git

Install Composer which will install Lumen’s dependencies:

>curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer

And use composer into install Lumen’s dependencies to get MirrorMirror up and running:

>cd MirrorMirror composer install

Goto to http://localhost and you should see your version of Mirror Mirror up and running!

Current Features:
------------------
* Displays forecast and animated weather icon.
* Displays Date and Time.
* Displays a random greeting, currently there’s only one but planning on adding more.
* There definitely needs to be more work to make this installation and customization process easier but I’m already thinking of ways to improve it. I hope you enjoy building/using your own magic mirror was much as I did mine!
